}
\arguments{
\item{trait}{The trait to analyze.}

\item{line}{The lines.}

\item{tester}{The testers.}

\item{rep}{The replication.}

\item{data}{The name of the data frame containing the data.}

\description{
This is a modified version of the \code{"lineXtester"} function of
package \code{"agricolae"} for the analysis of a Lina x Tester genetic design.

Data must correspond with a line by tester design and must be balanced.
If there are missing values they are not estimated and results can be dubious.
