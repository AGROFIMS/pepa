\title{Authomatic report for a MET with a RCBD}
\usage{
repo.met(traits, geno, env, rep, data, maxp = 0.1,
  author = "International Potato Center")
}
\arguments{
\item{traits}{The list of traits to include.}

\item{geno}{The genotypes.}

\item{env}{The environments.}

\item{rep}{The replications.}

\item{data}{The name of the data frame containing the data.}

\item{maxp}{Maximum allowed proportion of missing values to estimate, default is 10\%.}

\item{author}{Author.}
}
\value{
It returns an automatic report about the MET with a RCBD fitted model.
}
\description{
Produces an authomatic report for a set of selected traits in a multi environment
trial (MET) with a RCBD in each environment.
}
\details{
It fits a linear model for a MET with a RCBD for each trait.
If data is unbalanced, missing values are estimated up to an specified maximum
proportion, 10\% by default. Genotypes and environments are considered as fixed
factors while the blocks are considered as random and nested into the environments.
