\title{Automatic report for an augmented block design (ABD)}
\usage{
repo.abd(traits, treat, rep, data, author = "International Potato Center",
  format = c("html", "word", "pdf"))
}
\arguments{
\item{traits}{The traits to analize.}

\item{treat}{The treatments.}

\item{rep}{The replications.}

\item{data}{The name of the data frame.}

\item{author}{Author.}

\item{format}{The output file format for the report, \code{"html"} by default.
Other options are \code{"word"} and \code{"pdf"}.}
}
\value{
It returns an explanation about the ABD fitted model.
}
\description{
Produces an automatic report for selected traits in an experiment with an ABD.
}
\details{
It fits a linear model for an ABD and explains the results.

The Tukey HSD method for pairwise differences is applied.
Assumptions of the model are evaluated with residual plots.

# A subset that looks like an ABD

repo.abd(c("trw", "vw", "crw"), "geno", "rep", temp)

# With some missing values
