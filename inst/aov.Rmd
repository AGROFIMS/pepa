Congratulations! You have fitted a linear model. The ANOVA table for your model is
```{r, echo = FALSE}
anova(params$x)
noterms <- dim(anova(params$x))[1] - 1
pvalues <- anova(params$x)[1:noterms, 5]
```

Your model has `r noterms` terms
`r if(sum(pvalues < 0.05) > 0) {"and some of them are significant. That is really good! Have you checked your assumptions?" }`

`r if(sum(pvalues < 0.05) == 0) {"but none of them is significant. I am really sorry, but don't forget that p-values are a function of sample size, so maybe you can try with more replications next time." }`
