```{r, echo = FALSE}
object <- params$x
```

You have a nice data table with `r dim(pjpz09)[1]` rows and `r dim(pjpz09)[2]` columns. The first six rows are shown below:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
head(object)
```
Remember that the table is the standard format for data analysis; it is the kind of data structure that any statistical package prefers. In a table you have:

* one row for each observation (e.g. a plot, a pot or a plant) and
* one column for each variable (e.g. a trait like root yield or a factor like genotypes).
